To keep our CDN tidy follow these rules:
1. Never upload a file to the root directory here. Keep it organized into folders.
2. Use english words that pass a spell checker and separate words with a dash. Do not concatenate words together. 
3. File names must all be lower case letters, numbers, and the dash character.
4. If it is a file for an email, consider including the date (ISO format) in the file name.

Example of good names that follow best practices:
- `/promos/2018-provider-contest.png`
- `/phone-line/phone.mp3`

Example of names that will get you fired:
- `/Contests/2018_ProviderContest.png`
- `/StanleyRandomStuff/DCIM_009237774754312.png`
